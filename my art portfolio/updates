How to use and update this



Add Images:

Put your guitar.jpg (5117x6600) into the assets folder.

The code handles the resizing automatically so it looks good on the card, but when you click "View Full", it opens the full resolution in a new tab.



Add New Products:

Open script.js.

Look at the products list at the very top.
Copy the section between { ... }, and paste it again.

Change the id (make it unique, like 3, 4, 5), change the title, price, and image path.

Change type to either 'prints' or 'apparel' to make sure it shows up in the right category in the sidebar.



Change Fonts:

Go to styles.css.

At the very top, under :root, change --main-font.

If you want a different font, go to Google Fonts, select one, copy the <link> code into your HTML <head>, and update the CSS variable.



Run the site:
If you have the "Live Server" extension in VS Code (highly recommended), right-click index.html and click "Open with Live Server".
Otherwise, just double-click the index.html file in your folder, and it will open in Chrome/Edge/Safari.
